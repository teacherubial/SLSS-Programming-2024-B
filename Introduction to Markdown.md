**Hello** _world_.

This is **_markdown_**.

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) is a really useful tool. I also use [Google](https://google.com) to find things.

# Table in Markdown

## This is a level two header

Name           | Age         | Coolness     | Superpower
---            | ---         | ---          | ---
Batman         | Probably 30 | VERY         | RICH/smart
Mr. Ubial      | Pretty old  | His kids think he's cool | He can nap anywhere

To make a list we use the following:

* This is the first item in the list
* This is the second
    * This is actually a subpoint in this list

- This is also a list
- You can use these as bullets as well
    - You can also use sublists with dashes

1. This is the first item in an ordered list
3. This is the second
    1. This is a sublist
    2. Another item
        - This is unordered
        - Same here

# Blockquote

These are usually used to show quotes, things
people have said.
